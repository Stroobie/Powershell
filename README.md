# Stroobie's Sysadmin Scripts

Welcome to **Stroobie's Sysadmin Scripts**! This repository contains a collection of scripts Stroobie has put together to simplify life while being a sysadmin.



## ⚠️ **Disclaimer**
These scripts come **as is**. If you're not sure what a script is doing, it might be best not to run it. While Stroobie can promise the scripts are safe, using scripts effectively means practicing good security measures. If no one asks you to be careful, you won’t learn nothin'!

> **Remember:** Your security is your responsibility. Always review scripts and understand their impact on your system.
